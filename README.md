# SGiS
The propose of this Student Registration System (SGiS) project is to build a student registration system that will completely automate the process of new student registration in the university. The system will handle the document submission, testing process and registration of the new students. The system will be based and will have two implementations (i.e. client side [student] and server side [university]). Implementation on the server side can only be reached through the university intranet, while the client side can be reached by internet. The cycle begins as prospective students decide to enroll in class. They would be supposed to visit the university if they show interest in some course and will establish a user account at the administration door. It is the only aspect of the program where each user needs to provide human contact, which is meant as a protection mechanism to avoid fake user IDs from being generated. SGiS will assign the student a unique roll number and register them as a student of the university. This SGiS project will transfers the latest student information directly into the database of the university students.
